Simulations

 - What are the effects of different seeds?

   - call for simulators to explore statistical parameter space

 - How well do algorithms behave from one timestep to the next?

   - What is the time dependence of structure extraction methods?


Comparison of Simulation and Observation

 - What statistical comparisons are available?

   - Do PDFs contain any distinguishing power?
   - How do we compare filaments?

 - Hacar: bundle identifier not automated, so can't test directly against simulations

   - but, can look at simulated boxes by eye (Moeckel & Burkhert) 
   - Which techniques are affected by LOS confusion?
   - Are there methods to extract true 3rd dimension details?
