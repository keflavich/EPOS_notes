Summary

 - Support for strong field in obs
 - Filaments can be made by fields
 - Hourglass fields exist and connect large and small scales?
 - fields are bad for disks?

Most of the mass held up by B-fields?

 - Taurus, Pipe Nebula examples
 - polarization-based measurements

B-fields
--------

    Dick Crutcher



Focus Group
-----------

Troll questions:

 - Filaments aren't real.  Discuss.
 - How can multiwavelength data be used to reveal structures that are not
   visible (or obvious) in any single wavelength?
 - Who is more lognormal, me or Tom?
 - What is the least meaningful analysis technique?
   
   - What techniques should we NOT be using any more?  (hint: CMFs, N-PDFs...)

Faesi: negative pressure gradients

Clare Dobbs: Finding clouds in sims
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Major changes in extracted clouds between tiny timesteps using clumpfind

 - friends-of-friends approach more robust
 - can't reproduce Dame LV plot of Galaxy in simulations (Pettitt 2014)

Q: What do you compare between sim & obs?
A: Column? Intensity?

Anna McLeod - Extracting observables from simulations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Column-weighted temperature plots

Q Kainulainen: Which realization of the simulation?  What does random seed do?
A: Not sure.

Josep Girart - Connect large and small B-fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Planck polarization measured everywhere

Q Crutcher: Line linear polarization - extend to other species?  Onion skin
exploration using different species.
A: Problems...

Q: Tool to simulate Golreichs-Kallofos effect from simulations

Alvaro Hacar - Friends in Velocity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Gaussian fitting to decompose spectra into v/sigma/A

Only use delta-velocity for connection (after selecting on signal-to-noise)

Comparison to Moeckel's simulations - successful extraction

Q Hatchell: Nice way to condense a data cube.  What statistics are robustly
extracted?
A: Length, linewidth, velocity dispersion, mass

Q Peretto: How do you select # of components?
A: In groups - average a region, decide on # of components, then go again
(Very difficult - how do we automate the process?)

Ke Wang - Hierarchical structures in The Snake
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Obvious visibly - don't need clever techniques to examine

dendrogram - 3 branches

oscillation in velocity and position
 
 - mass flow along filament

Q Peretto: Velocity struture similar to simulations - is there something specific?
A: We see velocity oscillation in the simulation

Q Arce: Are stars forming in centers of bubbles?
A: Not obvious; there are cores in them (but not in center?)

Galactic Center discussion
==========================

My talk:
--------

Paul: could there be a boatload of low-mass stars?

Katharine:
----------


 - purely from PDF fitting: distribution too wide!  by a lot
 - used ~200-400 K for c_s [320 K]
 - extreme B-fields seem likely

Christine (Tom's student)
-------------------------

Longmore -> 0.01 msun/yr
Yusef-Zadeh = 0.1 msun/yr

YZ stars may be old, not YSOs!

Extended objects in CMZ are not YSOs

Leonardo: What if there are holes in the envelope?  There will be radiation
escaping, will still get extended sources.

Diederik: Wrong number from Longmore paper.  0.06 Msun/yr, not 0.01

Diederik
--------
80% of "dense gas emission" = nh3 1-1
Gas is in a ring rather than a disk
Size-linewidth: CMZ widths offset too high per size; apparently comparable to high-z
Turbulence maintenance?  

 - steady state bar inflow fails?
 - Episodic SF?

   - Exceed threshold at (ir)regular intervals?

Brick: sigma_rho ~2.08 from ALMA

My Q: Threshold for cluster formation?

 - there is no isolated star formation
 - stars don't form except in clusters

Ted Bergin - Chemistry
======================

C+ - dark molecular gas

OH+, H2O+  - ionization rate
CH+ 

Inversion transitions

 - H3O+ absorption in Sgr B2
 
   - density ~5000 cm^-3
   - hot molecular ISM throughout the galaxy?  
   - or: formation heating

Freezout of CO

 - proceeds toward CH3OH


Primordial carbon grains must be destroyed prior to planet formation

Organics were created in disks



Do other molecules have formation heating problems?

Can you use the formation heating of inverted molecules to infer something
about their O/P ratio?

 - H3O+ gas phase only
 - NH3 could be either

Paul Clark - CO
---------------

Larger clouds have more fractional CO because it doesn't need to be
self-shielded

High density drives down X-factor

Selecting high S/N lines of sight (resolved) makes for more consistent X-factor

Cloud density increases with UV & CR ionization rates

Neutral carbon best tracer of total gas

13CO does a great job... except at low metallicity
