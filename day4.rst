complex = >6 atoms
organic: C,H,O,N

Gas chemistry

 - recombination very slow

Grain chemistry favored

CH3OCH3, CH3CHO detected in prestellar cores

Nonthermal energy deposition required in prestellar cores

 - cosmic rays create local UV radiation
 - Irradiation of interstellar ice analogs in labs form COMs

Vasyunin & Herbst models

 - CH3OH and CH3OCHO are key tests

Radicals

 - CO -> HCO -> H2CO -> H3CO -> CH3OH
 - HCO always and CH3O 50% detected in corinos
 - HCO/H2CO ~ 0.1

Jaime: Are there any maps of complex molecules?  If not colocated spatially,
can you trust the ratio of abundances?
A: Trying to map.  Methanol very extended.  Other species are probably also
extended.

Q: Compare chemistry in L1157?
A: Haven't done it

Henning: Carbon core in ice mantle triggers ice mantle chemistry.  Lab data is
coming.

Padoan: 30K needed for desorption or for grain surface chem?
A: Grain surface chem - need energy on grain surfaces

Q: In pipe, methanol detected in all cores, A_V ~ 12.  NH3 is not more abundant
in more evolved cores.  How do you desorb CH3OH from grains?

Q Norldund: Can grain collisions desorb?  Rotation assists?
Henning: Not enough energy

Falgarone: Does finding chemistry invalidate hot corinos?
A: No, higher abundances in corinos
Q: What cross section do you use for emission calculations?
A: Faure is doing this

B68: "Exposed dense core"

Subsonic motions within cores

 - Kirk 2007
 - Pineda 2010, etc.

Infalling motion prevalent

 - Lee & Myers 2011 - contracting starless cores

Core velocities match environmental velocities (e.g. Hacar)

Lifetimes

 - How many have cores / how many don't?
 - starless / embedded ~ 1-3
 - 0.3 - 1.5 Myr age for starless cores (C2D + Perseus + GBS)
 - Jessop & Ward-Thompson: lifetime of cores drop with density... 1-5 t_ff

CMF vs IMF:

 - Motte 1998 -> Alves 2007 -> Konyves 2010
 - "Classical" notion: 1/3 SFE
 - Planck cold core survey: C3PO - these are clumps not cores

Core internals

 - "in dust we trust"
 - B68: Nielbok 2012
 - Grain models... factor of 2 now, can get to 10%

Shapes and B-fields

 - Oblate vs prolate?  Still unresolved
 - no correlation between B-field and core shape

Core chemistry

 - C-bearing disappear
 - N-bearing match core; ammonia goes too high in core of core...
 - freeze-out - Lippok 2014
 - deuteration increases as CO freezes

   - Ford & Shirley: depletion doesn't correlate with temperature / density

 - Keto & Caselli 2008: change of equation of state in center

   - study of EOS in cores stopped when Crapsi left astronomy

Connection of cores with larger scales

 - most mass doesn't get into cores
 - cores cluster
 - column threshold to form
 - more mass in cores in filaments

Tafalla & Hacar 2014: clustered cores in filaments

 - coherent velocity structure across whole filament
 - fibers are not turbulent
 - no gradient?

turbulent filaments fragment (fray) into coherent fibers


Is there any gradient along these filaments?  Are these perfectly perpendicular
to LOS or is there genuinely no motion along filament?  Would take 5 Myr to
merge along filament...
A: No?

Jaime: Fragmentation of cores?
A: Can't tell without ALMA

Klein: No evidence of fray in simulations.  Time dependent process.  No
evidence that "fray" is anything more than "filament"?
A: Chemistry says filaments come in families together.  Chemically younger
filaments are non-star-forming

Matthias: Strong-field case?  Maybe they exist in weak field, not strong field?
Klein: I'll look more closely.  Cartoons may obscure physics.

Zinnecker: Well-defined filaments should always provide cores of the same size?
Where does IMF come from?
A: Perturbed cylinders.  Grow as they go.

Scattered light in near, mid IR

 - 3.6 um emission
 - ridiculous 3d modeling
 - Galactic plane: can't see it
 - measurements of grain size distribution?

Modeling process

 - requires an additional local radiation field
 - more grains at 1um?

Bigger grains at center?

 - no, CONSTANT dust size distribution

L1506

 - low turbulence, low density, strong CO depletion
 - expanding motion on outside, infall motion inside
 - optically thin, but strong depletion
 - big grains at low density (can't grow them?)
 - Core must have been denser and more turbulent to grow grains

   - was it in a transient core before?

 - destructive processes limit lifetime of large grains
 - Lupus: correlated ice and coreshine

Clarification: Why is the K-band unreflective?

Q: What about the turbulence drives the grain growth?
A: Gradient?

Q Tom: Prospects of detecting polarization from coreshine?  Can it constrain?
A: Difficult.  Would be interesting - should be polarized.

Q Hacar: L1506 super boring kinematically
A: Not boring.

Q Hatchell: What does this mean for submm?
A: Waffles.

Q Henning: Can I comment on this?  No.
No effect on submm because already on rayleigh limit.

Q Joao: Amazing that dust size doesn't change across core.  Tielens says grains must change.
A: All the extinction is done by the small grains.  1um grains contain all the mass

Q Di Li: Do we have constraints on mass that will be missed due to concentration in grains?  How much mass between 0.1 and 1 micron?
A: Cannot answer.  Dust to gas ratio could be wrong.

QDA (?) WISE+AKARI+Planck to identify candidates

 - 1 million candidate YSOs
 - Malek 2013, Toth 2013
 - distance range ~few hundred pc to few kpc

Cloud cores fall below Lada relation?

Juvela: signs of increased submm opacity

Q Padoan: Million YSOs - can we investigate questions like size of cluster, SFE, or are there biases that prevent this?
A: Bias - missing most luminous objects.

Q Hacar: What is the contribution of stars to the cloud before/after removal?
A:

Q Joao: PACS+SPIRE vs just SPIRE: what differences in mass?
A: just looking at PACS-included to get a look at beta

Angular momentum regimes
Evidence of envelope mass decrease from class 0 -> I

Chemical history from episodic accretion

 - some indication of expanded CO-emitting regions of low-lum sources

Dunham: What is the re-freezout timescale?
A: ~10^4 years, but uncertain

Pineda: How do you remove envelope contribution when measuring C18O?
A: using simulations / models.  Using only long baselines

Basu: Can the change in chemistry change the evolution?
A: Probably not the thermal structure.  Or the ionization.

Henning: Can you determine optical depths to measure grain size distribution
with resolved obs?
A: 

Klein: What codes used for postprocessing?  How long do they take?
A: RADMC-3D and LIME

Substructure within cores needed to form stars
H2D+ misaligned with continuum source

Q Arce: X-ray, radio detections?
A: can't say much

Q Joao: parallel to compression wave?  Being crushed?
A: Maybe.  

Q Dunham: CO observations for outflows?
A: Bourke has data, but no CO

Q Bergin: What's the next step with ALMA?
A: Need outflows.   Disk-tracing lines at very high res.  Poln.  Band 9 is hard.

Q chair: First hydrostatic core - would it be detectable (in H2D+)?
A: Maybe?

Q Keto: Is there another H2D+ feature?
A: Yeah, there's a feature that doesn't track anything.  H2D+ confusing

Q Linz: Could the column density be not tracking the dust?
A: No, we have good sense of the temperature

Low multiplicity in Class 0 from CALYPSO
cm continuum survey of protostars
IRAS2A: double source, looks like outflows from both...
SMA, PDbI "multiples" are false positives?

Q Jaime: Are the multiples preferentially found in 1333?
A: Yes.  No velocity information

Q: Chance coagulation of blobs?
A: Need kinematics

Q Hatchell: Can Perseus be reconciled with protostar stats in other regions?
A: We will be covering other regions

Q Bergin: Why would multiplicity decrease with age?
A: 3-body interactions possible

Q Hans: Multiplicity doesn't change over Myr or Gyr.  Field carries information
about fragmentation.  How is this survey different from Connely?
A: They were limited to class I

Q Peretto: Where are the lost companions from Class 0 to Class I?  Can they be
found?
A: Depends on ejection timescale.  Beyond a few 1000 au, are they multiples?

Q Spectral Indices?
A: Yes, not yet...
