Intro: Juergen Steinecker
-------------------------
PPVI: "new paradigm for star formation" (observationally driven) = filaments
(how is that a paradigm?)

Derek Ward-Thompson: not a new paradigm

Steinecker: No central paradigm.


From galaxy scales to filamentary clouds: the earliest stages of star formation 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Clare Dobbs 
    U Exeter, Exeter, UK 
    (40m review talk)

What can galaxies do to inform local GMCs?
Do initial conditions matter for cloud formation?

Bate et al simulations are not simulations of molecular clouds - these are
clumps, overdensities

M51 PAWS: limited to M>10^5 msun

 - No observational counterpart to top-down view of GMCs at sub-pc resolution

Are molecular clouds universal?

 - Heyer & Brunt "Universal Turbulence" (Heyer 2009 plot)
 - Beaumont 2012: "universal cloud structure"
 - Lada 2010: tight correlation

   - Kauffmann 2010: dendrogram -> depends on what scale you examine

 - small fraction of gas is dense
 - Lada: SFR not universal
 
 - Bolatto 2008 claimed universal cloud properties across galaxies

   - PAWS shows radial dependence of cloud props
   - Major differences between, e.g., M33 and M51 in ΣH2

 - Meidt et al 2013: Arm-interarm differences significant
 - Schinerrer et al: CO vs H-alpha

   - Hα associated with spurs but NOT arms

 - special regions: CMZ, spiral arms, bars

   - CMZ low SFR
   - arms not affect SFR?
   - bars drive SF

 - Cloud lifetimes: short locally (few Myr?): Elmegreen 2000, Hartmann 2001, Reggiani
   2011, Jeffries 2011, Soderblom review 2014

   - extragalactic say longer, 30Myrs?

Where do GMCs come from?  Does it matter

   - Gravitational Instabilities: Jeans Mass, 'beads on a string' (Elmegreen 79)
   - Parker instability (Mouschouvias) - primarily in Galactic Center?
   - Cloud-cloud collisions.  Fukui 2014: NGC 3603 formed by cloud-cloud collision

     - may not be significant for SF: Rare to get clouds colliding along long axis
     - grazing collisions more likely

   - Colliding flows from OB stars and/or supernovae

     - Gravitational instability is faster: should not discuss these mechanisms
       in isolation

   - Grand design vs. flocculent doesn't seem to make much difference

   - more tidal features in AMR than SPH

Do clouds form from HI or H2 and does it matter?

    - Theoretically, doesn't matter
    - observationally, does: Koda 2013
    - No sharp transition from HI to H2 in Perseus: Lee, Stanimirovic et al 2012
    - Motte 2014: W43, HI -> H2 in bar
    - Inner galaxy GMCs more likely to form from CO (Scoville & Wilson 2004)
    - Pineda 2013, Langer 2014: dark H2 content has no radial variation

Bridging Galactic and SF scales

    - Renault 2013: low-res, full galaxy + short time, zoom-in
    - Rowan Smith: Section of galaxy at high res
    - "Galaxy Resimulations"
      
      - Big simulations by Tasker, Bonnell show KS relation 2 orders of
        magnitude too high
      - Feedback likely the solution

QUESTION: Fukui result - why is there a cloud *AFTER* the cluster has formed?
    Are there any hints from simulations whether the cloud should be observable
    after the cluster forms?
    While head-on collisions are rare, so are massive star clusters.  Do the
    counts match?

    - Yes.  Diederik says No.  Need more details.  Slopes don't match.  Some
      other mechanism drives the -1.7 slope to -2

    - Richard Klein: Need to discuss different initial conditions, technique,
      etc.  Don't overinterpret simulation comparison.  
      Q: Zoom-in - are you isolation peaks from a larger domain?  Does the 
      large sim continue?  Need larger scales to continue to affect
      small-scales
      A: No, larger sim does not continue.

    - Burkert? GMCs part of molecular network with no end.  How can you define a GMC?
      Can we define GMCs as bound component?

    - Zinnecker: Koda's work.  Lifetimes: Molecules live long, clouds live short.  ????
      A: I agree, sure.

Large-scale mapping of Star Formation Rate and Efficiency in the Milky Way 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sergio Molinari 
    INAF-IAPS, Rome, IT 
    (20 m talk)

 - focus on measuring SFR/SFE

 - summary of global SFRs

.. figure:: 2014-06-02%2010.10.04.jpg
   :width: 800px

 
HiGal catalog

 - ~10^5 sources
 - completeness estimation very difficult
 - add ATLASGAL, BGPS to SED

Distance Estimation

 - 60,000 with distance estimates excluding -10 < l < 14

SED analysis
 
 - luminosity - mass diagram: separate radio sources and accreting sources
 - 70um vs not: protostellar vs prestellar
 - mid-IR emitters tend to be associated with HII regions (75%, vs 8% for
   non-mid-IR emitters)
 - CH3OH masers occupy high L/M (Pestalozzi 2014 - similar to Cara's results)
 - Urquhart ATLASGAL luminous sources
 - (skipped Tan plot)
 - evolutionary models for stars: Veneziani estimate evolution for a cluster
 - Need self-consistent proto-cluster SED evolution (Tom R)
 - CMZ: Longmore found 2e-2 - ...
 - Urquhart RMS sources vs HiGal
 - Prestellar, protostellar overlap...
 - TOTAL SFR 1.6 Msun/yr
 - SFE: uniform-ish

Are there too many prestellar clumps?  What is the prestellar/protostellar
count / what is the lifetime?

Peretto: Expect protostellar sources are expected to be detectable further.
Why are the distance distributions the same?

Are you measuring total SFR from a subset of the data? YES: 1.6 is a
lower-limit!  not include outer galaxy, CMZ

Ke Wang: Normalized SFR - high value in local neighborhood?
No, probably an error...

Unfolding the Laws of Star Formation: The Density Distribution of Molecular Clouds
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Jouni Kainulainen 
    MPIA, Heidelberg, DE 

 - Regulation of SF at different scales
 - lognormal pdf -> sf
 - evolution of PDF poorly understood
 - Estimation of volume density pdf from column density pdf
   1. Wavelet filter of column density map: multi-scale source extraction
   2. Model each extracted structure as a nested prolate structure
   3. Compared to driven-turbulence-in-a-box simulations
   4. Apparently 20% accuracy
 - Power laws fit over most of the range; only fail at low densities
 - Power law and lognormal indistinguishable
 - ΣSFR correlated to PDF shape
 - Threshold: Maximum / cutoff around 5x10^3
 - SFE doesn't depend on DGMF

Ask: How badly does gravity affect your assumptions about the blobs?
     Nearby clouds are star forming; gravity clearly affects them but does not
     affect the turbulent box simulations.

Why is s=0 not at the center?

Tom: SFR vs sigma of lognormal - Could this be because more stuff is pushed
above threshold?  
hmm....

Diederik: SFE must depend on time when it is measured.  Selection bias in
observational data?
A: Possibly.  CURRENT SFE.

Crutcher: Assumption of prolate spheroids assumes LOS is smaller.  That might
be a problem - b-field, gravity violate, could make oblate spheroids.  How
sensitive to density?
A: Tested against numerical simulations.  Prolate did best empirically.

Steinecker: Concern about technique.  Filament - you lose information if you
only have column density.  Did you have long filaments?  
A: Inclination problem for sure.  Any single structure, uncertainty is high.
Hundreds -> average out nicely.  Likelihood of really bad estimates is low.

Sergio: Thresholds.  Artifact of maps you're using - highest density at
smallest spatial scales.
A: Had one cloud with much higher resolution.  Tiny change, 0.1 dex

Molecular cloud evolution and star formation in gravitationally unstable disk galaxies 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Andi Burkert 
    USM, Munich, DE 

(I'm no good at following this kind of talk)

Can explain everything with turbulent instability.  Feedback unnecessary.  Q is
only relevant parameter.

Galaxies are boxes fed from cosmic web.

Padoan: Too messy.
These clumpy looking things are flattened disks.

Q=1 drives all turbulence
Energy driven by accretion - radial flow releasing grav potential energy

Rowan Smith: Does the SN feedback in the simulation affect the timescales
claimed?
No.

Paul Clark: Rahul Shetty showed KS sublinear.  Doesn't this mess things up?
A: Oh, well, only a little sublinear... average over a whole galaxy, then it
becomes simple.

Jaime Pineda: Size-linewidth.  Why are the linewidths so large?  Are the clouds
resolved?  Are the linewidths from complexes?
A: Velocity dispersion measured from kpc-scale regions.

Hans: What observational prediction can you make?
A: Mdense / MH2 ~ 0.02
How do you measure it?
This is not my business!  OK, go to Galactic center, measure efficiency.
Diederik: 10% in Galactic center.  Toomre timescale is shorter.

Diederik: Point for feedback.  2% SFR/ff is feedback-regulated on cloud scales.
Accretion rate is also set by feedback: mass loading rate (outflow/inflow) > 1.
A: Yep, Galactic-scale feedback matters.

Evidence of Feedback? Class 0 Protostellar Fraction and Environment in the Perseus Molecular Cloud 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Sarah Sadavoy 
    MPIA, Heidelberg, DE 

Star forming clouds deviate from lognormal PDF (Kainulainen)
Focus on Perseus cloud

 - clump boundaries defined as boxes
 - 7 magnitude threshold... 5x10^21
 - correlation between surface density of class 0 sources and mass
 - Late-stage YSOs (class I and later) do not correlate
 - NGC 7538: CO 3-2 "circle" claimed as feedback evidence
    
   - but there is no central source.  That's not obviously driven by feedback.

 - somehow jet outflows increase density by sweeping up gas?
 - Summary: Column density distribution of cloud differs from column density
   distribution of clump
 - SFE, fraction, correlate with power-law slope, but only for class 0's
 - YSO feedback shapes clump structure...

Paul Clark: Compare SFR with Class 0's to Lada long-timescale averages
A: No, didn't calculate SFR because lifetime of class 0 too uncertain

Jouni Kainulainen: SFE as a function of PDF slope.  SFE of dense gas to infer
SF threshold?
A: Haven't done it, could be done.

Jaime Pineda: Correlation with mass of clump?
A: Yes, I've looked....
Jaime: We saw no evidence of feedback affecting anything in a complete survey
of Perseus.
A: Limited linewidth data for cores.

Sergio: Small numbers?  Poisson error bars?  1-sigma?
A: Errorbars are large.  Significance questionable?

?: Include more sources in each region - can you include "earlier" class Is?
A: 4-5 borderline sources.  Including them doesn't change much

Andy Burkert: Steeper slope as SFR ages.  But I see opposite - shallower as it
ages.
A: More stars is often younger - IC 348 is old, and relatively steep

Di Li: Why use PDF to characterize feedback?  Energy is resolvable.
A: plenty of work on outflows in Perseus.  Outflows don't have enough energy to
disrupt.  Studies haven't been clear.  (But, invoked Hatchell, Arce, etc. who
really definitively showed that the feedback is irrelevant)

Gritschneder: Couldn't the active region with other stars have the class
I/II/III stars dissolving the cores?
A: Not clear that those stars have more impact...

Joao: Couldn't you argue opposite?  Dense gas -> Class 0's? 
A: When do you go from producing class 0's to not...

Arce: There is tons of outflow data on Perseus: COMPLETE.  
A: Can't use 1-0 to characterize outflows

Turbulence
==========


    Edith Falgarone 
    ENS/OP, Paris, FR 

 - Breakthrough: ubiquitious mid-IR rotational lines of H2
 - Galaxies observed with dominant emission from H2 lines
 - 2D turbulence has an inverse cascade
 - MHD forced turbulence: local (neighboring) wavenumbers transfer energy
   
   - B-fields allow many nonlocal transfer mechanisms

 - intermittency

   - some very small regions fed with a lot of energy from the smallest scales
   - She & Leveque  2 pt correlation functions: departure from Kolmogorov
   - Lagrangian intermittency ... 
   - cool shapes of dissipation extrama - Momferratos

 - 40 km / s / pc shear in Polaris flare
 - non-gaussian wings at small scales, not seen at large-scales

Q: Di Li - Multiple velocity components looking like shear?
A: No.  The largest centroid velocity increments come from wings of single-dish
profiles

Q: Beuther - What is the shear doing?  Is there SF there?  What does it do, is
it special?
A: Shear leads to viscous dissipation

Burkhert: Why use Kolmogorov in heavily shocked medium?  Jumps scales;
intermediate scales don't matter
A: Only HI is Kolmogorov.  CNM may be transsonic

Krutcher: Lazarian says turbulence will drive magnetic reconnection.  Magnetic
reconnection can drive turbulence.
A: 

Q: Why is H2 connected to turbulent energy release rather than SF feedback?

SN-driven turbulence and GMC properties 
----------------------------------------

    Paolo Padoan 
    ICREA & ICC-UB, Barcelona, ES 
    http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/stein/EPoS/2014/C/PaoloPadoan.php

Discussing 3 simulations

 - 2 order of magnitude resolution improvement in 1x1x32 kpc box
 - SN compression along b-field lines
 - Most overdensities in ISM are transient
 - match 1-10^4 msun with simulation: simulation is of outer galaxy (R_G ~ 10 kpc)
 - "We solve the luminosity problem"

   - large spread (2 order of magnitude) in infall rate
   - order of magnitude variation in accretion rate
   - binaries: bursts of accretion at periastron
 
 - MCs driven by SNe
 - turbulence dissipates into convergent flows to make protostars

Q: Paul Clark - Numerical sleight of hand.  Is the SFR/ff as low in SN-driven
as in periodic box?  Most clouds are not bound.  SFR/ff low?
A: Requires time to examine

Q: Luminosity problem - are you getting no core?  No equilibrium core?
A: There are some cores with massive envelopes and no accretion
 
Q: Rowan Smith - Accretion drives turbulence... couldn't you just say gravity?
Why turbulence causing the accretion?
A: "For rather obvious reasons that I tried to explain before..." Gravity is
not 'grabbing anything' at alpha_vir ~ 10.  On small scales, gas is where it is
because of turbulence.

Richard Klein: Specious agreement.  No feedback in your simulations.  Can't
claim agreement between IMF and simulation unless you include feedback.
A: Occam's razor.   

Turbulent fragmentation and the stellar IMF 
--------------------------------------------

     Troels Haugboelle 
     STARPLAN, Copenhagen, DK 
     http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/stein/EPoS/2014/C/TroelsHaugboelle.php

 - try to resolve to core-scales
 - "Our agreement with the IMF is really good.  Therefore our physics must be
   right."
 - "most stars must form in clouds with alpha_vir <= 1

Jaime: Did you look at power spectrum?  Where is the turnover?
A: Power law down to 0.1 pc.  Limited to sonic scale.

Kritsuk: How do you refine?
A: Lagrangian.  Jeans?

Q: Limit on nearest neighbor distance.  Can you account for binaries?  Will
that change IMF?
A: Binaries are accounted for naturally.  Oh, well, the wide binaries.  Not
deriving the IMF from the neighbor plot.

Hans: Jeans criterion, temperature/pressure/density from turbulence -> mass
function.  Accretion component shifts peak.  Steepens lognormal to power law.
A: 

Henning: Assumed isothermal.  Cores are not isothermal.  What changes if cores
are not isothermal?  8K to 14-15K at edge
A: I call that isothermal.  Density by a factor of 100, temperature by 2

Richard Klein: Within an isothermal calculation, cannot get peak of IMF.  Need
to introduce a scale breaker.  Must be radiative feedback.  Larson laws
introduce scale.  More honest to "allow physics to do it".  
A: Only using normalization of Larson law.
Q: Have you followed simulation long enough to see the end of accretion, or is
it still going?  Have you exhausted the mass?
A: Accreting all mass is unphysical.  Gone 3 free-fall times

Henrik Beuther: Molecular Clouds and Turbulence summary
-------------------------------------------------------
VLA large program: THOR


Converging Flows
 
 - Falgarone: boundary conditions matter - can't do SF in a periodic box
 - Henning: can be done in different ways
 - Supervirial?
 - Hatchell: do convering flows affect forming stars, or just the initial
   conditions?
 - How do you observe converging flows?  HI is ubiquitous.
 - Maybe progressive from HI -> CO -> other?
 - Di Li: HI-H2 conversion.... can't use HI emission map.  Difficult
   observational problem.
 - Diederik: Difficult doesn't mean don't do it... we will see CO without
   associated HI.  Time evolution - can't compare HI vs HI+CO vs CO because
   they are different evolutionary stages.
 - Padoan: Look at supernovae, the awesome places where flows are awesomely
   converging awesome.
 - Andi: Large scale filaments from turbulence and low-mass quiescent filaments.
   Quiescent ones don't form from cooling instability
 - Falgarone: HI->H2 conversion - pure atomic gas doesn't exist.  H2
   self-shields extremely well.  Pure HI doesn't exist.
 - Diederik: If gravity plays a role in SF... only looking at tracers,
   observables...  cutting up a continuous process.
 - Hans: Koda talk - HI clouds to form H2 clouds, reshuffle over large
   timescales
 - Bergin: GMC dynamics longer than molecular / H2 formation timescale
 - Di Li: nearby clouds 99% H2.
 - Bergin: You don't know the H2 boundary, only the CO boundary
 - Diederik: Lifetimes.  Define lifetime as time between SF events.
 - Paul: Devil's advocate for Krumholz.  Single long-lived cloud forms stars
   for a long time.  Is it much more dynamic? Lifetime of clouds - >< 50 Myr?
   All moving away from long-lifetime picture
 - Bergin: 30 Myr come from cloud-intercloud motion
 - Historical note: Mouschouvias held up M51 with CO not overlapping Halpha,
   means long lifetimes.
 - Dobbs: PAWS shows significant CO not in clouds; not associated with
   overdensities.
 - Falgarone: Lots of low-density CO gas contributing to Galactic CO emission.
   Confirmed by Planck.  CO comes from not just GMCs
 - Henning: dense gas w/o star formation in M51
 - Hans: SFR 4/yr too high because of SNe
 - Molinari: Instantaneous measurement.

Feedback or no feedback?  

 - Klein: Feedback is crucial on small scales (star formation).  Both high and
   low mass.  Radiative heating, etc.  30 Dor feedback clearly crucial
 - Burkert: SNe don't put in enough energy
 - Padoan: 70 pc upper scale for turbulence

Large Molecular Filaments in the Milky Way 
-------------------------------------------


    Thomas Henning, Sarah Ragan, Jochen Tackenberg et al. 
    MPIA, Heidelberg, DE 
    http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/stein/EPoS/2014/C/ThomasHenning.php

Are converging flows important in galaxies?

 - The Snake, G11
 - submm misses large fraction of overall reservoir
 - Look for flows along filaments in N2H+ line

   - contact discontinuity at clump

 - Nessie associated with a spiral arm -> assumption that they are all in arms

   - Battersby & Bally filament fragmented
   - Guanxing Li 500pc "filamentary wisp"

"Giant Molecular Filaments": provide definition

 - PAWS has 40pc resolution.  Only see spurs (filaments) in outside of galaxy
 - by-eye search for structures
 - One structure perpendicular to galactic plane at G41.1
 - linear mass/length 500-2500 msun/pc
 - lengths ~60-230 pc

GMFs don't live in spiral arms

 - one, maybe 2 of 7 in spiral arms
 - comparison to Rowan Smith AREPO data: lots of spurs

Can you find the full extent of filaments in molecular lines?  Can't deeper
observations fix that?
What are your biases?  Why didn't you identify W51, for example?
