Hierarchy of Filaments from 0.1 to 100 pc

 - High density filaments correlated with low-density filaments in, e.g., Orion
 - M16/M17 shell - filamentary?
 - W43: gradients toward central cloud.

   - inflow streams along scutum-centaurus arm

Filaments of different scales / types

 - polaris ridge vs DR21
 - high resolution bayesian sed fitting: Palmeirim 2013, Hill 2011-2012.
 - sub-critical vs supercritical filaments

   - Ostriker '64 thermally critical value ~15 Msun/pc
   - supercritical filaments accreting along "striations"
   - polarization: drift along b-field lines

 - DR21-type filaments = ridges
   
   - more massive, supercritical
   - fragmenting as they form
   - accreting mass through sub-filaments

 - Mon R2: Hub-filament

   - r^-2.5 density profile

More precise measurements of density structure

 - Spheroids (Kainulainen), Crest (Arzoumanian), cylinders (Menschikov, Schizano)
 - wavelet vs curvelet
 - 10-20% of structure in filaments, to 50% in ridges, or few % in hubs
 - DisPerSE - Sousbie 2011
 - "nest" in Vela
 - Mean densities of 10^4 over 5-10pc^2 regions
 - Taurus B213 filament

   - filaments form at dissipation scale of turbulence

 - Andre's "Paradigm of SF" - threshold at A_V ~ 8

   - 0.1 pc scale
   - Explicable from ion-neutral friction (Hennebelle & Andre 2013)
   - Globally collapsing filaments have steeper profiles (Gomez & Vazquez-Semadeni 2014)
   - Steeper profile observed in DR21

     - "Braiding" filaments in DR21

Kinematics of filaments

 - Global infall in DR21 at 0.2-1 km/s
 - Braids of filaments
 - Coherent filaments being mixed at 5 km/s velocity difference
 - SFE in W43: Louvet, Motte, Hennebelle 2014
 - SFRff vs virial parameter Louvet 2014 in W43
 
   - SFRff rising faster than predicted

Into cores...

 - Csengeri: flows with shear at locations of filaments
 - Broad SiO emission: shear?
 - Braiding in low-mass filaments too
 - Mass of clump in filament matches mass in filament
 - prestellar dense cores meaningful in ridges?
     

QUESTION:
What is the best evidence for flow along a filament?


Exploring the filamentary initial conditions of star formation using AREPO
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ZAH/ITA, Heidelberg, DE 
    http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/stein/EPoS/2014/C/RowanSmith.php

Why is filamentary geometry common?

 - Simulations show accretion through/along filaments
 - AREPO on filaments...

   - Galactic disk with imposed spiral potential
   - refine on a tiny zone that tracks the galaxy...
   - kpc-long filaments in interarm zone

     - only small components of clouds observable in CO

   - dark gas fraction 42% (<0.1 K km/s)

     - partially molecular - 30 cm^-3


 - do simulated match observed?
   
   - ran disperse on simulations
   - no b-fields; flat p~2 profile (not p~4 Ostriker filaments)
     
     - p ~ 2 not sufficient to prove b-fields
     - parameters of radial profile fit are badly correlated

   - Arzoumanian fits are only to flat inner section, out to R ~ 0.4
   - 0.3 pc width when fitting the whole filament

     - FWHM not constant in simulations

Filaments in 3D

 - substructured cross section of filaments

   - filament constructed of a series of smaller structures
   - subfilaments created by turbulence, dragged together by gravity?

QUESTION: The CO-dark gas has high column.  Should it then be observable in extinction?

Toward a predictive theory of SF...

 - more realistic initial conditions
 - lots of simulation description
 - gorgeous multi-scale movie
 - Comparison of PDF to Kainulainen and Tan
 - strong-field core model

   - matches Crutcher's measurements perfectly

 - weak field hinders accretion

   - weak field inconsistent with observations

    http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/stein/EPoS/2014/C/AlvaroHacar.php

Distinct velocity components; stars form from the dense...

 - bundle of fibers

   - cores within fibers
   - 2-3 cores per fiber within star-forming fibers

 NGC 1333

   - 50% of gas subsonic when resolved

     - the bundles have broader lines

   - transsonic lines everywhere

 Taurus vs NGC1333 : surface density is difference

Radiation Problem

 - radiation mhd simulations

   - Magnetic braking prevents disc formation (Comercon)

 - Peters: fragmentation-induced starvation -> upper mass limit
 - Massive stars with discs (?):

   - Toroids or disks?  Rotationally supported?
   - do disks exist around O-stars?

     - ALMA G35.20 Sanchez-Monge

Fragmentation on ~100 AU scales

 - Myers 2013 RHD simulations of cores
 - Palau: correlation of fragmentation with density profile

   - B-fields seem important?

 - Simulations of dense clumps collapsing...

Do massive prestellar cores exist?

 - Observationally: Tan 2013, Duarte-Cabral 2013, Beuther 2013
 - Cyganowski in prep: massive (200 msun) starless core with NO lines ??
 - Peretto ALMA: global collapse in an IRDC
 - Peretto SDC13: 80 msun core
 - Henshaw 2013: convergent flows toward cores

Large scale triggering

 - colliding flows (Clark, etc.)
 - external ionization (Dale & Bonnell)
 - Walch: vary fractal dimension -> no change in outcome, but major change in appearance
 - Constrain colliding flows?

   - Motte: converging flows in W43, Louvet 2014...

 - Thompson 2012: 14-30% of massive stars on bubble edges

Massive prestellar cores probably don't exist

 - but PROTOSTELLAR do exist

Richard Klein: Peters' work doesn't include dust-processed radiation; not clear
that frag-induced starvation is real

Protostellar Outflows and their Effect on Star Formation, from Disk to Cloud Scales 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Hector Arce

    http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/stein/EPoS/2014/C/HectorArce.php

Collimation from B-fields, not from envelope

 - velocity gradients observed in outflows
 - launching consistent with disk wind
 - outflow cavity expands over time

   - spherical winds in late Class II phase?

 - Offner & Arce: 0.4 SFE from outflows
 - Core destruction timescales longer than lifetime of protostar

   - but, outflow mass/energy/momentum underestimated
   - Dunham 2014
   - Yildiz showed outflow temperatures hotter than 50K
     
     - higher T at higher V

 - outflows could still be the core disruptors
 - outflows can replace turbulence on core scales
 - clustered outflows in NGC 1333 with CARMA
 - Wang, Nakamura, Li - outflows can drive turbulence in clusters
 - B59: outflow has created cavity
 - Outflows affect 1-4 pc scales, but not very large scales

   - A/B stars drive shells that contribute to turbulence on cloud scales

 - NGC 1333: outflows seem to affect dense gas
 - pc-scale outflows
 - chemistry can connect large and small scales



Q (me): Is the core disruption by outflow mass dependent?  What effect does that have on CMF->IMF mapping?
A: I don't know.  Maybe Jenny does

Di Li: Outflow replenish turbulence - Larson's law.  Energy is injected at outflow scale.  
A: Don't know the observational properties of outflows well enough to measure 

Di: Should see anticorrelation between outflow total kinetic energy and SFE?
A: ?? (I thought the SFE is only set by outflows on core scales)

Bergin: What can outflows tell us about episodic accretion?
A: Lots

Chat Hull: What's the largest twist in an outflow?
A: big in MSFRs

Alvaro Hacar: Same region to say opposite things.  *Cloud* is not affected but *cores* are.
A: True, larger scales are not affected by outflows

    http://www.mpia-hd.mpg.de/homes/stein/EPoS/2014/2014prog.php

High detection rate of faint, outflow-associated radio sources toward infrared objects

 - flat spectral index: -1.5 to +1.5, but mean ~0
 - flux correlated with luminosity.... or Lyman continuum... Anglada 1995
 - momentum injection rate of outflow well correlated with radio luminosity
 - outflow in G11 (snake) consistent with thermal emission

Keto: Why do you think these are jets and not small HII regions?
A: millimeter counterparts

Zinnecker: How are the jets ionized?
A: We don't know.

Dunham: Are the jets always extended?  We detect all in Perseus as point
sources with spectral indices consistent with thermal.
A: For most HMCs, they are extended.  For CMCs, mostly point sources.

Hatchell: Many multiple sources.  How often are those uniquely interpreted as
one jet vs many?
A: We don't detect stellar multiples.

Simon Bihr: Do you look for / see line emission?
A: Too weak. ~100 uJy

What have we learned since 2007?

 - rehash: massive stars are clusters
